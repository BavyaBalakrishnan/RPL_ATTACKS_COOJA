# RPL_ATTACKS_COOJA
RPL is a routing protocol designed for low power and lossy networks which contains devices constrained in memory, energy and processing power. Such devices will operate at low data
rate and experience relatively significant packet losses. In addition to that due to the open environment in which they operate devices are more susceptible to several security attacks. In
this paper we analyse the various attacks on RPL protocol using simulation in contiki platform. We are mainly concentrating on the attacks at the network layer. Main objective is to test and
show the effect of some chosen attacks using Cooja Simulator
